Timing
- all musical timing is based on ticks (a relative measure of time)
- beats are defined as a fixed number of ticks (usually 96)
- tempo is declared in bpm (and consequently determines tick duration)
- LATER: time signature is declared as num_notes / note_value
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_value

Generators
- generators are monophonic emitters of event sequences (velocity, note values, timing, ...)
- each event has an integer value which can also be undefined (for pauses)
- generators can produce data several beats ahead of the current position
- 

Markov Chain Generators
- all note sequences are built from phrases (which could be one-note phrases)
- phrases are user-provided, and referred to by a unique ID
- 

EventPayload
  int value
  int numTicks

Note
